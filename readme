I used the precept handouts and lecture 3 to base my DFA on.
I thought the contain nano example was especially helpful to
see what a textual dfa looked like.
In step 6, I used the precept handout to issue gcc commands to build
my program.
I also asked ChatGPT a few questions on how to issue certain gcc
commands and to ask it a few clarifing questions on how to handle
new lines.

What is your assessment of the assignment? Was it helpful? Was it fun?

I thought the assignment was super helpful in understanding DFAs.
I thought it tied together a lot of key concepts that we learned in
lecture. However, given how many states there were, it was a little
difficult to debug and took more time than I thought.
