Textual representation of the "Does the string have an unterminated
comment (\*) in it" DFA. The DFA "accepts" a given sequence of
characters if it contains no unterminated comments. The DFA
"rejects" a given sequence of characters if the sequence contains an
unterminated comment.

START (accept) <-- the start state
      /: SLASH
      ": IN_STRING
      ': IN_CHAR
      \n: START (Action: print newline)
      other: START (Action: print char)

SLASH (accept)
      *: IN_COMMENT
      /: SLASH (Action: print /)
      ": IN_STRING (Action: print /, then ")
      ': IN_CHAR (Action: print /, then ')
      \n: START (Action: print /, then newline)
